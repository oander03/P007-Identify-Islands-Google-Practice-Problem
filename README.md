# Identify Islands | Google Practice Problem
The function takes in a "map" which is made up of 1s and 0s. The 1s represent land and the 0s represent water. 
The purpose of this function is to count how many islands there are in the map. Islands count as multiple 
1s connected above, left, right, or below each other. Two 1s connected diagonally count as 2 islands.
